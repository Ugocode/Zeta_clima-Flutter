## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We'll look at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What you will create

We’re going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end of the module, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
